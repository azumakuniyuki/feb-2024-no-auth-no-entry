Feedback Loop

If you’re a large volume sender, you can use the Feedback Loop (FBL) to
identify campaigns in your traffic that are getting a high volume of complaints
from Gmail users. The FBL is particularly useful to email service providers to
detect abuse of their services.

Note: FBL data will only pertain to @gmail.com recipients.

How to implement the FBL

Senders will need to embed a new header called the Feedback-ID, consisting of
parameters (called "Identifiers") that uniquely identify their individual
campaigns. Any Identifiers with an unusual spam rate and that might cause
deliverability issues will be reported in the Postmaster Tools FBL dashboard.

Header format

Feedback-ID: a:b:c:SenderId

  • Feedback-ID: Name of the Header to be embedded.
  • a, b, c: Optional fields that can be used by the sender to embed up to 3
    Identifiers (campaign/customer/other).
  • SenderId: Mandatory unique Identifier (5–15 characters) chosen by the
    sender. It should be consistent across the mail stream.

About the data

The aggregate data will be generated for the first 4 fields (as separated by
‘:’) of the Feedback-ID:, starting from the right side. If the SenderId is
empty, no data will be generated. If another field is empty, data will be
generated for the rest of the fields.

In order to prevent spoofing of the Feedback-ID, the traffic being sent to
Gmail needs to be DKIM signed by a domain owned (or controlled) by the sender,
after the addition of this header. This domain should be added and verified to
the Gmail Postmaster Tools, so the sender can access the FBL data.

  • Senders should ensure that their traffic has only one such verified header.
  • Senders will have to publish the IPs from which they’re sending mail in the
    SPF records of their signing domains. The sending IPs must have PTR records
    and resolve to a valid hostname (preferably one of the DKIM domains).
  • For a given day’s traffic, FBL reports are generated only if a given
    Identifier is present in a certain volume of mails as well as in distinct
    user spam reports.
  • FBL data will be aggregated on each Identifier independently. This also
    allows for the use of less than 3 Identifiers, if needed.
  • For a given day's traffic, the sender should ensure that the Identifiers
    across fields not repeated, so that data is not aggregated across unrelated
    Identifiers. If there is a concern about the uniqueness of the Identifier
    namespace, or if the sender prefers for the data to be grouped between two
    Identifiers, the hash of one Identifier can be appended to the other.
  • When choosing the Identifiers, the sender should not use a parameter that
    will be unique across every single mail (for example, a unique Message-ID).

Below is an example for illustration:

Feedback-ID: CampaignIDX:CustomerID2:MailTypeID3:SenderId

  • CampaignIDX: Campaign Identifier specific to Customer2 and is unique across
    the board (that is, no 2 customers share the same campaign ID).
  • CustomerID2: Unique customer Identifier.
  • MailTypeID3: Identifier for the type of mail (for example, a newsletter
    versus a product update) and can be either unique or common across
    customers, based on how the sender wants to view the data.
  • SenderId: Sender's unique Identifier and can be used for overall
    statistics.

In the above case, we would send the spam percentages for each of the 4
Identifiers independently, if they had an unusual spam rate.
