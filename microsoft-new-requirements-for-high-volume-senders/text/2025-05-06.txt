Strengthening Email Ecosystem: Outlook’s New Requirements for High‐Volume
Senders

This applies to Outlook.com - our consumer service, which is supporting
hotmail.com live.com and outlook.com consumer domain addresses.

April 29th Update - Changes have been made to the action take on messages that
do not meet requirements, please see details below.

Introduction

In an era where email remains one of the most widely used tools for personal
and business communications, Outlook is stepping up its commitment to protect
inboxes and preserve trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, we’re announcing
new requirements and best practices designed to strengthen email authentication
for domains sending more than 5,000 emails per day. 

These new requirements will enforce stricter standards by including mandatory
SPF, DKIM, DMARC settings. Outlook is pushing the broader industry toward best
practices and safeguarding the millions of individuals and small businesses
that rely on us every day. These measures will help reduce spoofing, phishing,
and spam activity, empowering legitimate senders with stronger brand protection
and better deliverability. 

Outlook has always prioritized user safety and reliability; we’re proud to
further invest in this solution that will keep our customers safe and reinforce
the best practices across the industry. We believe that by raising the bar for
large senders, we can inspire lasting change that benefits everyone. 

What's Changing?

For domains sending over 5,000 emails per day, Outlook will soon require
compliance with SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Non‐compliant messages will first be routed
to Junk. If issues remain unresolved, they may eventually be rejected. Senders
will soon start requiring compliance with the following requirements: 

 1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
      □ Must Pass for the sending domain.
      □ Your domain's DNS record should accurately list authorized IP addresses
        /hosts.
 2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
      □ Must Pass to validate email integrity and authenticity.
 3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
      □ At least p=none and align with either SPF or DKIM (preferably both).

Learn more about email authentication here.

Additional Email Hygiene Recommendations

Large senders should also adopt these practices to maintain quality and trust:

  • Compliant P2 (Primary) Sender Addresses: Ensure the “From” or “Reply‐To”
    address is valid, reflects the true sending domain, and can receive
    replies. 

  • Functional Unsubscribe Links: Provide an easy, clearly visible way for
    recipients to opt out of further messages, particularly for marketing or
    bulk mail. 

  • List Hygiene & Bounce Management: Remove invalid addresses regularly to
    reduce spam complaints, bounces, and wasted messages. 

  • Transparent Mailing Practices: Use accurate subject lines, avoid deceptive
    headers, and ensure your recipients have consented to receive your
    messages. 

Outlook reserves the right to take negative action, including filtering or
blocking—against non‐compliant senders, especially for critical breaches of
authentication or hygiene. 

Enforcement Timeline

Starting today, we encourage all senders and particularly those that send at
high volume to review and update their SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, in
preparation for when the enforcement begins, starting in May. 

After careful consideration and to ensure the protection of users and remove
any confusion on why a message was in the junk folder for both the recipient
and sender, we have made a decision to reject messages that don't pass the
required authentication requirements detailed above. The rejected messages will
be designated as "550; 5.7.515 Access denied, sending domain [SendingDomain]
does not meet the required authentication level."  This change will state
taking effect on May 5th as originally stated. 

[DEL:After May 5th, 2025, Outlook will begin routing messages from high volume
non‐compliant domains to the Junk folder, giving senders an opportunity to
address any outstanding issues. NOTE: that in the future (date to be
announced), non-compliant messages will be rejected to further protect users.  
 :DEL]

Next Steps

  • Prepare Now: Audit your DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and verify you meet
    all the requirements. To view the authentication header, visit this. To

  • Stay Informed: We’ll provide updates on official rollout schedules, and
    dates for when rejection actions will begin through a blog post. 

  • Join Our Mission: Embracing better authentication and hygiene not only
    benefits your deliverability but also helps protect the entire email
    ecosystem.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

 1. Why is Outlook requiring these changes specifically for high‐volume
    senders?
      □ Large senders have a broader impact on inbox safety. By focusing on
        senders of 5,000+ messages a day, we significantly reduce the
        likelihood of spam and spoofing campaigns reaching our user base. 
 2. How do SPF, DKIM, and DMARC help me as a sender?
      □ These authentication protocols verify your emails for recipients.
        Compliant senders often see improved deliverability, fewer
        bounce‐backs, and stronger brand credibility.
 3. Do I still need to do this if I send fewer than 5,000 emails/day?
      □ While enforcement first targets large senders, all senders benefit from
        these best practices. Strong authentication protects your reputation.
 4. What exactly is a “functional” unsubscribe link?
      □ It’s a link placed in your email that allows recipients to quickly opt
        out of future mail. It should be easy to find and reliable when
        clicked.
 5. Will these changes stop all spam?
      □ No system eliminates spam entirely, but these measures make it much
        harder for malicious actors to succeed and give legitimate senders
        higher trust.
 6. What does “alignment” mean for DMARC?
      □ Alignment ensures the “From” domain matches (or sub domain) the domain
        used by SPF and/or DKIM. This prevents bad actors from exploiting your
        domain name.
 7. My SPF record has multiple include statements—could that cause issues?
      □ If you exceed 10 DNS lookups, your SPF check might fail. Tools exist to
        “flatten” your record or reduce the number of includes.
 8. Why does Outlook recommend ARC for forwarding/mailing lists?
      □ Forwarding can break DMARC alignment. ARC preserves the original
        authentication checks, preventing legitimate forwarded mail from being
        wrongfully flagged.
 9. How often should I clean my mailing lists?
      □ Aim to remove inactive or invalid addresses regularly—monthly or
        quarterly. This lowers bounce rates, cuts costs, and reduces spam
        complaints.
10. If I use a 3rd‐party email vendor, do I still need SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
    in my domain DNS?
      □ Yes. Even if you outsource sending, authentication is tied to your
        domain. Coordinate with your provider to ensure correct DNS settings.
11. How does Outlook handle DMARC aggregate (rua) and forensic (ruf) reports?
      □ We send RUA to the addresses specified in your DMARC record. You can
        analyze these to see who is sending on behalf of your domain, spot
        domain abuse, and confirm alignment. We don’t have plans to send RUF.
12. Can separate mail systems have unique DKIM selectors?
      □ Yes. Managing multiple selectors (e.g., selector1, selector2) helps
        maintain clarity and isolate reputation concerns across various
        business units or campaigns. Learn more about how to configure DKIM
        here.
13. Does publishing a strict DMARC policy (p=reject) offer better security?
      □ Absolutely, once your legitimate sources are aligned, p=reject is the
        most effective at thwarting domain spoofing. We advise moving gradually
        (none → quarantine → reject) to avoid unintended mail loss.
14. If someone regularly reports my emails as spam despite authentication, what
    can I do?
      □ Authentication ensures emails are from you, but user perception still
        matters. Review your content, frequency, and opt‐out process to ensure
        recipients remain engaged and not overwhelmed. 
15. Will adding to safe senders list bypass the new enforcement? 
      □ No. Safe Sender list won’t be honored.

    Please help me understand:

    Is the 5000 email threshold counted per Microsoft domain or combined across
    hotmail.com, outlook.com, and live.com?

    If a sender crosses the threshold once, are they permanently considered a
    bulk sender?

        He said "We don't plan to expand this to Enterprise yet. Enterprise
        environments have complex mail flows that can break DMARC. We’ll get
        there eventually, but not with this release. This is focused only on
        Microsoft's consumer services."

    Is SPF alignment required?  eg if contoso.com sends mail via MailChimp, the
    "From" address may be a contoso.com address, but the envelope sender will
    still be a MailChimp address, and with DKIM signatures for both domains.

        No, alignment of either SPF or DKIM is sufficient.

    "550; 5.7.15 Access denied, sending domain [SendingDomain] does meet the
    required authentication level."

    I think you missed a word there Puneeth

    How or where do or can I generate a DKIM for "Windows Live Domains"?
    It is old, but I really need to add a DKIM record I read here...

    PuneethDMARC defines two types of reports: aggregate reports and failure
    reports. The term 'forensic reports' is incorrect and should not be used.
    To encourage adoption and reduce unnecessary confusion, it's important to
    use accurate terminology.

    Hi Puneeth ,
    I have a question.

     

    The email delivery service I'm currently using doesn't have a Reply-To
    header set, only a Return-Path header. If the sender sends a "no-reply"
    email through this service (the address is RFC-compliant, but doesn't
    exist), how will this guideline be evaluated?

    I would like to know if a correctly set Return-Path header is evaluated
    equally to the From and Reply-To headers.

    Is this affecting only free inboxes, or all inboxes behind corporate public
    domains?

    I would love to hear more about this recommendation: 

      □ Compliant P2 (Primary) Sender Addresses: Ensure the “From” or
        “Reply‐To” address is valid, reflects the true sending domain, and can
        receive replies.

    Will senders have a more challenging path to the inbox if they use email
    address removed for privacy reasons as their From: address? When you say
    "can receive replies," how will this be measured (will you send an email to
    test, or look for a valid MX record, or ...?)?

        I would also to better understand this Puneeth. The language "Compliant
        P2 (Primary) Sender Addresses: Ensure the “From” or “Reply‐To” address
        is valid, reflects the true sending domain, and can receive replies" is
        a bit confusing. Does this mean both the From and Reply-To need be
        valid, or both? We employ a "no-reply" reply-to address, as I'm
        guessing quite a few other bulk senders do. 

        We also use a marketing sub-domain of a corporate domain. The corporate
        domain is used for personal email addresses and thus obviously is a
        valid address. Does that mean we would not have issues?

            This is regarding RFC compliance. We have observed that many
            senders are using non-RFC-compliant P2 sender addresses, either
            unknowingly or for questionable reasons. Recent developments on
            this topic are discussed in Our New Approach to Non-RFC Compliant
            Emails blog. In the future, we may start blocking these emails, so
            as a general recommendation, we encourage all senders to ensure
            their P2 sender addresses comply with RFC standards.

        Hah! It removed my sample email address for privacy reasons. Replying
        here so it's clear that my example was noreply @ (sender domain).
