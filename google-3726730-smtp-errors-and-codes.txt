Gmail SMTP errors and codes

[ZVRPQAc5O4]

You might see the following error messages and codes when using Gmail
with Google Workspace . The messages and codes are helpful tools for diagnosing
and troubleshooting email problems.

Gmail appends one or both of the following identifiers to all error messages to
show you the source of the error: 

  • gsmtp (Google SMTP) is added to all errors. 
  • gcdp (Google Custom Domain Policies) is added to errors resulting from
    customized rules created by the administrator. 

For example, "550 5.7.1 This message violates example.com email policy. - gcdp
<sessionid> - gsmtp" indicates that the error is a result of a custom rule
created by the administrator.

550   5.7.24 The SPF record of the sending domain has one or more suspicious
             entries. For more information, go to Email sender guidelines.

             The IP address sending this message does not have a PTR record
             setup, or the corresponding forward DNS entry does not point to
550   5.7.25 the sending IP. As a policy, Gmail does not accept messages from
             IPs with missing PTR records. For more information, go to Email
             sender guidelines.

             The sending IP does not match the IP address of the hostname
550   5.7.25 specified in the pointer (PTR) record. For more information, go to
             Email sender guidelines.

             This email has been blocked because the sender is unauthenticated.
             Gmail requires all senders to authenticate with either SPF or
550   5.7.26 DKIM. Authentication results: DKIM = did not pass SPF [domain-name
             ] with ip: [ip-address] = did not pass. For instructions on
             setting up authentication, go to Email sender guidelines. 

             The (E)MAIL FROM domain [domain-name] has an SPF record with a
             hard fail policy (-all) but it fails to pass SPF checks with the
550   5.7.26 ip: [ip-address]. To best protect our users from spam and
             phishing, the message has been blocked. For more information, go
             to Email sender guidelines.

             Unauthenticated email from domain-name is not accepted due to
550   5.7.26 domain's DMARC policy. Contact the administrator of domain-name
             domain if this was legitimate email. To learn about the DMARC
             initiative, go to Control unauthenticated email from your domain.

             This email has been blocked because SPF does not pass. Gmail
             requires all large senders to authenticate with SPF.
550   5.7.27 Authentication results: SPF domain-name with ip: ip-address = did
             not pass. For instructions on setting up SPF authentication, go to
