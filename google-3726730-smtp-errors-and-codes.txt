Gmail SMTP errors and codes

You may see the following error messages and codes when using Gmail with Google
Workspace . The messages and codes are helpful tools for diagnosing and
troubleshooting email problems.

Gmail appends one or both of the following identifiers to all error messages to
show you the source of the error: 

  • gsmtp (Google SMTP) is added to all errors. 
  • gcdp (Google Custom Domain Policies) is added to errors resulting from
    customized rules created by the administrator. 

For example, "550 5.7.1 This message violates example.com email policy. - gcdp
<sessionid> - gsmtp" indicates that the error is a result of a custom rule
created by the administrator.

For more information, visit About SMTP error messages.

Note: Error #2014 is related to a Chrome browser extension. Disable your Chrome
extensions one at a time to determine which extension is causing the error. The
full text of error #2014 is: Oops... the system is experiencing a problem (#
2014) - Try again.
