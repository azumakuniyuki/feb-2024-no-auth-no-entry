    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    This section provides troubleshooting information for senders who are having trouble reaching Outlook.com users by
    email. If you are an Outlook.com user looking for support with your account, please visit our <a
        href="https://support.office.com/article/40676ad0-c831-45ac-a023-5be633be798d?product=newmail&amp;version=17.5.3327.6000&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;wlexpid=78946cb3-43f8-4634-8bc8-caa9cac0c43d&amp;server=DUB131-W94&amp;accountTier=0&amp;errorCode=noerrors" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        end user support page
    </a>
    <br /><br />
    If you are experiencing problems delivering email to Outlook.com please first ensure that you are following all of
    the requirements found on our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/ip-domain-management-snds/Postmaster/Policies">Policies and
        Guidelines</a> page.
    <br /><br />
    <h3>Common Problems</h3>
    <br />
    <h4>Are you managing your IP and domain's sending reputation?</h4>
    Microsoft's SmartScreen® technology is designed to provide anti-spam filtering innovations for Outlook.com as well
    as other Microsoft products like Exchange Server, Microsoft Office Outlook and Windows Live Mail. We also leverage
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        SPF
    </a>
    , an email authentication technology
    protocol that helps address the problem of spoofing and phishing by verifying that the domain sending the email is
    authorized to do so. SmartScreen® email filters are influenced by a number of factors related to the sending IP,
    domain, authentication, list accuracy, complaint rates, content and more. Of these, one of the principal factors in
    driving down a sender's reputation and deliverability is their junk email complaint rate.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Are you sending email from new IPs?</h4>
    IPs not previously used to send email typically don't have any reputation built up in our systems. As a result,
    emails from new IPs are more likely to experience deliverability issues. Once the IP has built a reputation for not
    sending spam, Outlook.com will typically allow for a better email delivery experience.
    <br /><br />
    New IPs that are added for domains that are authenticated under existing SPF records typically experience the added
    benefit of inheriting some of the domain's sending reputation. If the domain has a good sending reputation new IPs
    may experience a faster ramp up time. A new IP can expect to be fully ramped within a couple of weeks or sooner
    depending on volume, list accuracy and as long as their junk email complaint rates are kept at a minimum.
    <br /><br />
    Note: don't forget to update your Junk Email Reporting Program (JMRP) account with the new IPs. To update or set up
    a JMRP account, go to <a href="https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JMRP Enrollment</a>.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Are you running Anti-Virus software?</h4>
    Some of the deliverability issues are the result of sender-based software configurations. If you are running
    anti-virus software on your firewall or SMTP server, check for the setting "Internet Email Auto Protect" or
    "Internet Email Protection." If this setting is enabled, disable it and try sending a test message to our servers
    again.
    <br /><br />
    If you are currently running Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition 9.x or 10.x on your server, please review <a
        href="http://g.live.com/9wc9en-us/antispam" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        antispam recommendations</a> from Symantec Support.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Confirm that your DNS is set-up correctly</h4>
    Try connecting to mail.hotmail.com via port 25. If you are unable to connect, then attempt to telnet over port 25
    directly to our email servers (MTAs). You can find the current list of our MTAs by querying "nslookup –q=mx
    hotmail.com" from a command prompt (this should work in a variety of Operating Systems). Currently, the addresses
    for these servers are mx1.hotmail.com, mx2.hotmail.com, mx3.hotmail.com and mx4.hotmail.com. If that doesn't work,
    try connecting directly to the IPs. If you are able to connect directly to the IP and not mail.hotmail.com, then it
    is likely there is an issue with your DNS server.
    <br /><br />
    Occasionally, some of the IPs in our MX record may be out of service. If you are connecting to one of these IPs your
    connection may timeout. Make sure you test all of our published IPs. You may also configure your outbound email
    server to do a round-robin DNS lookup for Outlook.com.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Are you advertising yourself as a non-routable IP?</h4>
    We may not accept email from senders who fail a reverse-DNS lookup. In some cases legitimate senders advertise
    themselves incorrectly as a non-internet routable IP when attempting to open a connection to Outlook.com. IP
    addresses that are reserved for private (non-routable) networking are 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, and 172.16.0.0/11
    (or 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255, 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255).
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Sender services, tools, and issue submission</h4>
    We have developed some tools and services which will give you more information about how our users are rating your
    email. These services have been tailored for senders and for ISPs. To learn more about the Sender and ISP Services,
    go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/ip-domain-management-snds/Postmaster/Services">Services</a>.
    <br /><br />
    If your email complies with our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/ip-domain-management-snds/Postmaster/Policies">policies and
        guidelines</a> and you are still experiencing email delivery problems that are not addressed in the FAQ below,
    go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=614866" rel="noreferrer noopener">Support</a> to contact support.
    <br /><br />
    Note: Deliverability issues submitted using this form should only be related to the Outlook.com system, including
    any address @msn.com, @Outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com. We will do our best to help you troubleshoot
    your issue. However, submitting this information does not guarantee that any message you send to users of the
    Outlook.com services will be delivered.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Are you blocked for namespace mining?</h4>
    Senders must not use namespace mining techniques against Outlook.com inbound email servers. This is the practice of
    verifying email addresses without sending (or attempting to send) emails to those addresses. This method is commonly
    used by malicious senders to generate lists of valid e-mail addresses that they can send spam, phishing emails or
    malware. Microsoft does not allow this behavior and takes action on IPs that engage in it. If any of your sending
    IPs is blocked for namespace mining, please check that your machines or email sending accounts are not compromised
    by an attacker who may be using your servers to harvest email addresses, and ensure that any method you use to
    validate email addresses does not use namespace mining techniques.
    <br />
    
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <br />
    <h4>Why does the email that I send to Outlook.com users sometimes look different from what they receive?</h4>
    Avoid using scripting languages as they may be removed from your message. Many email messages now contain HTML code
    similar to that found in a Web page. This often helps with formatting and design. Outlook.com now analyzes and
    processes HTML content to remove HTML code that may be unsafe for your computer. This change is part of Microsoft's
    overall Trustworthy Computing Initiative and was made to further reduce the risk of malicious HTML content reaching
    our users.
    <h4>How can I prevent my messages from being marked as from an "unknown sender" in the Outlook.com interface?</h4>
    One way to ensure that your messages aren't marked as being from an "unknown sender" is to join <a href="https://www.validity.com/sender-certification/" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        Validity's Sender Certification program</a>, a third-party accreditation and reputation
    service that provides Outlook.com with a list of responsible senders. Alternatively, if an Outlook.com user adds
    your domain or email address to their " contacts" or their "safe-senders list" they will no longer see this
    notification. In addition, senders who are on the Validity's Sender Certification list or on a user's "safe sender's" list
    typically experience links and images within their messages enabled by default.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>Does Outlook.com operate an "allow list" that I can get on?</h4>
    No. An "allow list" is essentially a "free pass" which allows emails from certain senders to bypass junk email
    filters and other precautions. Outlook.com evaluates all inbound email for malicious content. You can find out more
    about our filtering processes in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/ip-domain-management-snds/Postmaster/JunkEmail">Fighting Junk Email</a>. We do,
    however, partner with Validity. who helps ensure the legitimacy of certain senders via their Sender Certification program. This program allows Outlook.com to exercise greater assurance about mail from certified
    senders in good standing. You can learn more about the Validity's Sender Certification program in <a href="https://www.validity.com/sender-certification/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sender Certification</a>.
    <br /><br />
    <h4>How do I avoid having my messages marked as potentially dangerous?</h4>
    To help prevent your messages from being identified as possibly fraudulent:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Always use valid, reputable URLs. Make sure it's clear where the recipient will be taken and whether the
            destination is a valid website.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the standard URL format. Avoid using IP addresses in the URL.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whenever possible, publish your Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not link to known phishing sites.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why did I receive a "550 command rejected due to Sender ID validation failure." SMTP Non-Delivery Report (NDR)
        when I attempt to send mail to Outlook.com users?</h4>
    Outlook.com will not allow delivery of email sent from a domain where the Sender ID record was configured by the
    domain owner to NOT allow ANY IP to send mail from that domain. Sender ID allows a domain owner to protect domains
    that aren't intended for sending email in order to help protect their domain from being spoofed. This can be done by
    publishing a simple TXT record in DNS like the following example (note: the organization would replace example.com
    with their own domain and or sub-domain name):
    <br /><br />
    example.com IN TXT "v=spf1 -all"
    <br /><br />
    If the domain is repurposed to send mail, the administrator of the DNS record should update the Sender ID record to
    include the IP address(s) that are authorized to send mail from that domain. Note that updates to your Sender ID
    record can take up to 48 hours to propagate through the Internet, so it's a good idea to wait 48 hours after making
    a change to your record before you initiate any new email activities. In addition, Microsoft strongly recommends
    that you conduct email testing prior to sending live communications to your users/customers.
