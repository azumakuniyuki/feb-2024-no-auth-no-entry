Gmail SMTP errors and codes

[ZVRPQAc5O4]

You might see the error messages and codes on this page when send email to
Gmail accounts.The messages and codes can help you troubleshoot and resolve
email delivery problems.

Gmail appends one or both of these identifiers to all error messages: 

  • gsmtp (Google SMTP) is added to all errors. 
  • gcdp (Google Custom Domain Policies) is added to errors resulting from
    customized rules created by a Google Workspace administrator. 

For example, "550 5.7.1 This message violates example.com email policy. - gcdp
<sessionid> - gsmtp" means that the error is a result of a custom rule created
by the administrator.

             entries. For more information, go to Email sender guidelines.

             This message was blocked because the sending IP address doesn’t
             have a PTR record, or the forwarding DNS entry doesn’t reference

             This email has been blocked because the sender is unauthenticated.
             Gmail requires all senders to authenticate with either SPF or
550   5.7.26 DKIM. Authentication results: DKIM = did not pass SPF [domain-name
             ] with ip: [ip-address] = did not pass. For instructions on
             setting up authentication, go to Email sender guidelines.

             initiative, go to Control unauthenticated email from your domain.
