                    Troubleshooting

                    This section provides troubleshooting information for
                    senders who are having trouble reaching Outlook.com users
                    by email. If you are an Outlook.com user looking for
                    support with your account, please visit our end user
                    support page.
                    If you are experiencing problems delivering email to
                    Outlook.com please first ensure that you are following all
                    of the requirements found on our Policies and Guidelines
                    page.

                    Common Problems

                    Are you managing your IP and domain's sending reputation?

                    Microsoft's SmartScreen® technology is designed to provide
                    anti-spam filtering innovations for Outlook.com as well as
                    other Microsoft products like Exchange Server, Microsoft
                    Office Outlook and Windows Live Mail. We also leverage SPF
                    , an email authentication technology protocol that helps
                    address the problem of spoofing and phishing by verifying
                    that the domain sending the email is authorized to do so.
                    SmartScreen® email filters are influenced by a number of
                    factors related to the sending IP, domain, authentication,
                    list accuracy, complaint rates, content and more. Of these,
                    one of the principal factors in driving down a sender's
                    reputation and deliverability is their junk email complaint
                    rate.

                    Are you sending email from new IPs?

                    IPs not previously used to send email typically don't have
                    any reputation built up in our systems. As a result, emails
                    from new IPs are more likely to experience deliverability
                    issues. Once the IP has built a reputation for not sending
                    spam, Outlook.com will typically allow for a better email
                    delivery experience.
                    New IPs that are added for domains that are authenticated
                    under existing SPF records typically experience the added
                    benefit of inheriting some of the domain's sending
                    reputation. If the domain has a good sending reputation new
                    IPs may experience a faster ramp up time. A new IP can
                    expect to be fully ramped within a couple of weeks or
                    sooner depending on volume, list accuracy and as long as
                    their junk email complaint rates are kept at a minimum.
                    Note: don't forget to update your Junk Email Reporting
                    Program (JMRP) account with the new IPs. To update or set
                    up a JMRP account, click here.

                    Are you running Anti-Virus software?

                    Some of the deliverability issues are the result of
                    sender-based software configurations. If you are running
                    anti-virus software on your firewall or SMTP server, check
                    for the setting "Internet Email Auto Protect" or "Internet
                    Email Protection." If this setting is enabled, disable it
                    and try sending a test message to our servers again.
                    If you are currently running Symantec AntiVirus Corporate
                    Edition 9.x or 10.x on your server, please review this
                    article from Symantec Support.

                    Confirm that your DNS is set-up correctly

                    Try connecting to mail.hotmail.com via port 25. If you are
                    unable to connect, then attempt to telnet over port 25
                    directly to our email servers (MTAs). You can find the
                    current list of our MTAs by querying "nslookup –q=mx
                    hotmail.com" from a command prompt (this should work in a
                    variety of Operating Systems). Currently, the addresses for
                    these servers are mx1.hotmail.com, mx2.hotmail.com,
                    mx3.hotmail.com and mx4.hotmail.com. If that doesn't work,
                    try connecting directly to the IPs. If you are able to
                    connect directly to the IP and not mail.hotmail.com, then
                    it is likely there is an issue with your DNS server.
                    Occasionally, some of the IPs in our MX record may be out
                    of service. If you are connecting to one of these IPs your
                    connection may timeout. Make sure you test all of our
                    published IPs. You may also configure your outbound email
                    server to do a round-robin DNS lookup for Outlook.com.

                    Are you advertising yourself as a non-routable IP?

                    We may not accept email from senders who fail a reverse-DNS
                    lookup. In some cases legitimate senders advertise
                    themselves incorrectly as a non-internet routable IP when
                    attempting to open a connection to Outlook.com. IP
                    addresses that are reserved for private (non-routable)
                    networking are 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, and 172.16.0.0/
                    11 (or 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255, 10.0.0.0 -
                    10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255).

                    Sender services, tools, and issue submission

                    We have developed some tools and services which will give
                    you more information about how our users are rating your
                    email. These services have been tailored for senders and
                    for ISPs. To learn more about the Sender and ISP Services,

                    Are you blocked for namespace mining?

                    Senders must not use namespace mining techniques against
                    Outlook.com inbound email servers. This is the practice of
                    verifying email addresses without sending (or attempting to
                    send) emails to those addresses. This method is commonly
                    used by malicious senders to generate lists of valid e-mail
                    addresses that they can send spam, phishing emails or
                    malware. Microsoft does not allow this behavior and takes
                    action on IPs that engage in it. If any of your sending IPs
                    is blocked for namespace mining, please check that your
                    machines or email sending accounts are not compromised by
                    an attacker who may be using your servers to harvest email
                    addresses, and ensure that any method you use to validate
                    email addresses does not use namespace mining techniques.

                    Frequently Asked Questions

                    Why does the email that I send to Outlook.com users
                    sometimes look different from what they receive?

                    Avoid using scripting languages as they may be removed from
                    your message. Many email messages now contain HTML code
                    similar to that found in a Web page. This often helps with
                    formatting and design. Outlook.com now analyzes and
                    processes HTML content to remove HTML code that may be
                    unsafe for your computer. This change is part of
                    Microsoft's overall Trustworthy Computing Initiative and
                    was made to further reduce the risk of malicious HTML
                    content reaching our users.

  • End-User
    Support         Does Outlook.com operate an "allow list" that I can get on?

                    No. An "allow list" is essentially a "free pass" which
                    allows emails from certain senders to bypass junk email
                    filters and other precautions. Outlook.com evaluates all
                    inbound email for malicious content. You can find out more
                    about our filtering processes here. We do, however, partner
                    with Return Path, Inc. who helps ensure the legitimacy of
                    certain senders via their Return Path Certification
                    program. This program allows Outlook.com to exercise
                    greater assurance about mail from certified senders in good
                    standing. You can learn more about the Return Path
                    Certification program here.

                    How do I avoid having my messages marked as potentially
                    dangerous?

                    To help prevent your messages from being identified as
                    possibly fraudulent:

                      • Always use valid, reputable URLs. Make sure it's clear
                        where the recipient will be taken and whether the
                        destination is a valid website.
                      • Use the standard URL format. Avoid using IP addresses
                        in the URL.
                      • Whenever possible, publish your Sender Policy Framework
                        (SPF) records.
                      • Do not link to known phishing sites.

                    Why did I receive a "550 command rejected due to Sender ID
                    validation failure." SMTP Non-Delivery Report (NDR) when I
                    attempt to send mail to Outlook.com users?

                    Outlook.com will not allow delivery of email sent from a
                    domain where the Sender ID record was configured by the
                    domain owner to NOT allow ANY IP to send mail from that
                    domain. Sender ID allows a domain owner to protect domains
                    that aren't intended for sending email in order to help
                    protect their domain from being spoofed. This can be done
                    by publishing a simple TXT record in DNS like the following
                    example (note: the organization would replace example.com
                    with their own domain and or sub-domain name):
                    example.com IN TXT "v=spf1 -all"
                    If the domain is repurposed to send mail, the administrator
                    of the DNS record should update the Sender ID record to
                    include the IP address(s) that are authorized to send mail
                    from that domain. Note that updates to your Sender ID
                    record can take up to 48 hours to propagate through the
                    Internet, so it's a good idea to wait 48 hours after making
                    a change to your record before you initiate any new email
                    activities. In addition, Microsoft strongly recommends that
                    you conduct email testing prior to sending live
                    communications to your users/customers.
