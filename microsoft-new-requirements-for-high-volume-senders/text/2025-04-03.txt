Strengthening Email Ecosystem: Outlook’s New Requirements for High‐Volume
Senders

This applies to Outlook.com - our consumer service, which is supporting
hotmail.com live.com and outlook.com consumer domain addresses.

Introduction

In an era where email remains one of the most widely used tools for personal
and business communications, Outlook is stepping up its commitment to protect
inboxes and preserve trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, we’re announcing
new requirements and best practices designed to strengthen email authentication
for domains sending more than 5,000 emails per day. 

These new requirements will enforce stricter standards by including mandatory
SPF, DKIM, DMARC settings. Outlook is pushing the broader industry toward best
practices and safeguarding the millions of individuals and small businesses
that rely on us every day. These measures will help reduce spoofing, phishing,
and spam activity, empowering legitimate senders with stronger brand protection
and better deliverability. 

Outlook has always prioritized user safety and reliability; we’re proud to
further invest in this solution that will keep our customers safe and reinforce
the best practices across the industry. We believe that by raising the bar for
large senders, we can inspire lasting change that benefits everyone. 

What's Changing?

For domains sending over 5,000 emails per day, Outlook will soon require
compliance with SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Non‐compliant messages will first be routed
to Junk. If issues remain unresolved, they may eventually be rejected. Senders
will soon start requiring compliance with the following requirements: 

 1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
      □ Must Pass for the sending domain.
      □ Your domain's DNS record should accurately list authorized IP addresses
        /hosts.
 2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
      □ Must Pass to validate email integrity and authenticity.
 3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
      □ At least p=none and align with either SPF or DKIM (preferably both).

Additional Email Hygiene Recommendations

Large senders should also adopt these practices to maintain quality and trust:

  • Compliant P2 (Primary) Sender Addresses: Ensure the “From” or “Reply‐To”
    address is valid, reflects the true sending domain, and can receive
    replies. 

  • Functional Unsubscribe Links: Provide an easy, clearly visible way for
    recipients to opt out of further messages, particularly for marketing or
    bulk mail. 

  • List Hygiene & Bounce Management: Remove invalid addresses regularly to
    reduce spam complaints, bounces, and wasted messages. 

  • Transparent Mailing Practices: Use accurate subject lines, avoid deceptive
    headers, and ensure your recipients have consented to receive your
    messages. 

Outlook reserves the right to take negative action, including filtering or
blocking—against non‐compliant senders, especially for critical breaches of
authentication or hygiene. 

Enforcement Timeline

Starting today, we encourage all senders and particularly those that send at
high volume to review and update their SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, in
preparation for when the enforcement begins, starting in May. 

After May 5th, 2025, Outlook will begin routing messages from high volume
non‐compliant domains to the Junk folder, giving senders an opportunity to
address any outstanding issues. NOTE: that in the future (date to be
announced), non-compliant messages will be rejected to further protect users.  
 

Next Steps

  • Prepare Now: Audit your DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and verify you meet
    all the requirements. To view the authentication header, visit this. To

  • Stay Informed: We’ll provide updates on official rollout schedules, and
    dates for when rejection actions will begin through a blog post. 

  • Join Our Mission: Embracing better authentication and hygiene not only
    benefits your deliverability but also helps protect the entire email
    ecosystem.

channel for everyone. 

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

 1. Why is Outlook requiring these changes specifically for high‐volume
    senders?
      □ Large senders have a broader impact on inbox safety. By focusing on
        senders of 5,000+ messages a day, we significantly reduce the
        likelihood of spam and spoofing campaigns reaching our user base. 
 2. How do SPF, DKIM, and DMARC help me as a sender?
      □ These authentication protocols verify your emails for recipients.
        Compliant senders often see improved deliverability, fewer
        bounce‐backs, and stronger brand credibility.
 3. Do I still need to do this if I send fewer than 5,000 emails/day?
      □ While enforcement first targets large senders, all senders benefit from
        these best practices. Strong authentication protects your reputation.
 4. What exactly is a “functional” unsubscribe link?
      □ It’s a link placed in your email that allows recipients to quickly opt
        out of future mail. It should be easy to find and reliable when
        clicked.
 5. Will these changes stop all spam?
      □ No system eliminates spam entirely, but these measures make it much
        harder for malicious actors to succeed and give legitimate senders
        higher trust.
 6. What does “alignment” mean for DMARC?
      □ Alignment ensures the “From” domain matches (or sub domain) the domain
        used by SPF and/or DKIM. This prevents bad actors from exploiting your
        domain name.
 7. My SPF record has multiple include statements—could that cause issues?
      □ If you exceed 10 DNS lookups, your SPF check might fail. Tools exist to
        “flatten” your record or reduce the number of includes.
 8. Why does Outlook recommend ARC for forwarding/mailing lists?
      □ Forwarding can break DMARC alignment. ARC preserves the original
        authentication checks, preventing legitimate forwarded mail from being
        wrongfully flagged.
 9. How often should I clean my mailing lists?
      □ Aim to remove inactive or invalid addresses regularly—monthly or
        quarterly. This lowers bounce rates, cuts costs, and reduces spam
        complaints.
10. If I use a 3rd‐party email vendor, do I still need SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
    in my domain DNS?
      □ Yes. Even if you outsource sending, authentication is tied to your
        domain. Coordinate with your provider to ensure correct DNS settings.
11. How does Outlook handle DMARC aggregate (rua) and forensic (ruf) reports?
      □ We send RUA to the addresses specified in your DMARC record. You can
        analyze these to see who is sending on behalf of your domain, spot
        domain abuse, and confirm alignment. We don’t have plans to send RUF.
12. Can separate mail systems have unique DKIM selectors?
      □ Yes. Managing multiple selectors (e.g., selector1, selector2) helps
        maintain clarity and isolate reputation concerns across various
        business units or campaigns. Learn more about how to configure DKIM
        here.
13. Does publishing a strict DMARC policy (p=reject) offer better security?
      □ Absolutely, once your legitimate sources are aligned, p=reject is the
        most effective at thwarting domain spoofing. We advise moving gradually
        (none → quarantine → reject) to avoid unintended mail loss.
14. If someone regularly reports my emails as spam despite authentication, what
    can I do?
      □ Authentication ensures emails are from you, but user perception still
        matters. Review your content, frequency, and opt‐out process to ensure
        recipients remain engaged and not overwhelmed. 
15. Will adding to safe senders list bypass the new enforcement? 
      □ No. Safe Sender list won’t be honored.
