Sender Solutions

Email abuse, junk email, and fraudulent emails (phishing) continue to burden
the entire email ecosystem. To help build back consumer trust in the use of
email, Microsoft has put in place various policies and technologies to help
protect our consumers. However, Microsoft understands that legitimate email
senders should not be negatively affected. Therefore, we have established a
suite of services to help senders improve their deliverability to Outlook.com
consumers by proactively managing their sending reputation.

Below is an overview of services that can benefit your organization including
links for more information:

ISP Solutions

Microsoft understands that no single organization can change or eliminate email
abuse on its own. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play a major role in
identifying and curbing abuse as they host millions of email accounts around
the world. Therefore, we have built some services to help ISPs gain a good
understanding of the type of traffic originating from their networks and
reaching Outlook.com customers. ISPs can then use this data to help stop
abusive activity (junk email, phishing, etc.) on their networks in order to
reduce overall costs and proactively manage their reputation.
