Strengthening Email Ecosystem: Outlook’s New Requirements for High‐Volume
Senders

Apr 02, 2025

This applies to Outlook.com - our consumer service, which is supporting
hotmail.com live.com and outlook.com consumer domain addresses.

April 29th Update - Changes have been made to the action take on messages that
do not meet requirements, please see details below.

Introduction

In an era where email remains one of the most widely used tools for personal
and business communications, Outlook is stepping up its commitment to protect
inboxes and preserve trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, we’re announcing
new requirements and best practices designed to strengthen email authentication
for domains sending more than 5,000 emails per day. 

These new requirements will enforce stricter standards by including mandatory
SPF, DKIM, DMARC settings. Outlook is pushing the broader industry toward best
practices and safeguarding the millions of individuals and small businesses
that rely on us every day. These measures will help reduce spoofing, phishing,
and spam activity, empowering legitimate senders with stronger brand protection
and better deliverability. 

Outlook has always prioritized user safety and reliability; we’re proud to
further invest in this solution that will keep our customers safe and reinforce
the best practices across the industry. We believe that by raising the bar for
large senders, we can inspire lasting change that benefits everyone. 

What's Changing?

For domains sending over 5,000 emails per day, Outlook will soon require
compliance with SPF, DKIM, DMARC. Non‐compliant messages will first be routed
to Junk. If issues remain unresolved, they may eventually be rejected. Senders
will soon start requiring compliance with the following requirements: 

 1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
      □ Must Pass for the sending domain.
      □ Your domain's DNS record should accurately list authorized IP addresses
        /hosts.
 2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
      □ Must Pass to validate email integrity and authenticity.
 3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
      □ At least p=none and align with either SPF or DKIM (preferably both).

Learn more about email authentication here.

Additional Email Hygiene Recommendations

Large senders should also adopt these practices to maintain quality and trust:

  • Compliant P2 (Primary) Sender Addresses: Ensure the “From” or “Reply‐To”
    address is valid, reflects the true sending domain, and can receive
    replies. 

  • Functional Unsubscribe Links: Provide an easy, clearly visible way for
    recipients to opt out of further messages, particularly for marketing or
    bulk mail. 

  • List Hygiene & Bounce Management: Remove invalid addresses regularly to
    reduce spam complaints, bounces, and wasted messages. 

  • Transparent Mailing Practices: Use accurate subject lines, avoid deceptive
    headers, and ensure your recipients have consented to receive your
    messages. 

Outlook reserves the right to take negative action, including filtering or
blocking—against non‐compliant senders, especially for critical breaches of
authentication or hygiene. 

Enforcement Timeline

Starting today, we encourage all senders and particularly those that send at
high volume to review and update their SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, in
preparation for when the enforcement begins, starting in May. 

After careful consideration and to ensure the protection of users and remove
any confusion on why a message was in the junk folder for both the recipient
and sender, we have made a decision to reject messages that don't pass the
required authentication requirements detailed above. The rejected messages will
be designated as "550; 5.7.515 Access denied, sending domain [SendingDomain]
does not meet the required authentication level."  This change will state
taking effect on May 5th as originally stated. 

[DEL:After May 5th, 2025, Outlook will begin routing messages from high volume
non‐compliant domains to the Junk folder, giving senders an opportunity to
address any outstanding issues. NOTE: that in the future (date to be
announced), non-compliant messages will be rejected to further protect users.  
 :DEL]

Next Steps

  • Prepare Now: Audit your DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and verify you meet
    all the requirements. To view the authentication header, visit this. To

  • Stay Informed: We’ll provide updates on official rollout schedules, and
    dates for when rejection actions will begin through a blog post. 

  • Join Our Mission: Embracing better authentication and hygiene not only
    benefits your deliverability but also helps protect the entire email
    ecosystem.

channel for everyone. 

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

 1. Why is Outlook requiring these changes specifically for high‐volume
    senders?
      □ Large senders have a broader impact on inbox safety. By focusing on
        senders of 5,000+ messages a day, we significantly reduce the
        likelihood of spam and spoofing campaigns reaching our user base. 
 2. How do SPF, DKIM, and DMARC help me as a sender?
      □ These authentication protocols verify your emails for recipients.
        Compliant senders often see improved deliverability, fewer
        bounce‐backs, and stronger brand credibility.
 3. Do I still need to do this if I send fewer than 5,000 emails/day?
      □ While enforcement first targets large senders, all senders benefit from
        these best practices. Strong authentication protects your reputation.
 4. What exactly is a “functional” unsubscribe link?
      □ It’s a link placed in your email that allows recipients to quickly opt
        out of future mail. It should be easy to find and reliable when
        clicked.
 5. Will these changes stop all spam?
      □ No system eliminates spam entirely, but these measures make it much
        harder for malicious actors to succeed and give legitimate senders
        higher trust.
 6. What does “alignment” mean for DMARC?
      □ Alignment ensures the “From” domain matches (or sub domain) the domain
        used by SPF and/or DKIM. This prevents bad actors from exploiting your
        domain name.
 7. My SPF record has multiple include statements—could that cause issues?
      □ If you exceed 10 DNS lookups, your SPF check might fail. Tools exist to
        “flatten” your record or reduce the number of includes.
 8. Why does Outlook recommend ARC for forwarding/mailing lists?
      □ Forwarding can break DMARC alignment. ARC preserves the original
        authentication checks, preventing legitimate forwarded mail from being
        wrongfully flagged.
 9. How often should I clean my mailing lists?
      □ Aim to remove inactive or invalid addresses regularly—monthly or
        quarterly. This lowers bounce rates, cuts costs, and reduces spam
        complaints.
10. If I use a 3rd‐party email vendor, do I still need SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
    in my domain DNS?
      □ Yes. Even if you outsource sending, authentication is tied to your
        domain. Coordinate with your provider to ensure correct DNS settings.
11. How does Outlook handle DMARC aggregate (rua) and forensic (ruf) reports?
      □ We send RUA to the addresses specified in your DMARC record. You can
        analyze these to see who is sending on behalf of your domain, spot
        domain abuse, and confirm alignment. We don’t have plans to send RUF.
12. Can separate mail systems have unique DKIM selectors?
      □ Yes. Managing multiple selectors (e.g., selector1, selector2) helps
        maintain clarity and isolate reputation concerns across various
        business units or campaigns. Learn more about how to configure DKIM
        here.
13. Does publishing a strict DMARC policy (p=reject) offer better security?
      □ Absolutely, once your legitimate sources are aligned, p=reject is the
        most effective at thwarting domain spoofing. We advise moving gradually
        (none → quarantine → reject) to avoid unintended mail loss.
14. If someone regularly reports my emails as spam despite authentication, what
    can I do?
      □ Authentication ensures emails are from you, but user perception still
        matters. Review your content, frequency, and opt‐out process to ensure
        recipients remain engaged and not overwhelmed. 
15. Will adding to safe senders list bypass the new enforcement? 
      □ No. Safe Sender list won’t be honored.

    I can't comment on the techical details but I can confirm that the
    aggressiveness of Microsoft's approach here is causing real pain to real
    people. This week we purchased event tickets via axs.com using a forwarded
    personal domain email address which we have used for well over 20 years. It
    was (is) set to resolve to an outlook.com address. We received the first 2
    emails confirming the purchase and that the tickets were available, that
    must be accessed in the app. Downloaded the app, tried to sign in, told
    email address is unverified: must click link to verify. But no verify email
    address was ever received: now sure it was bounced by outlook.com,
    presumably sent by a service system configured differently from the sales
    one. With axs support this was overcome but required a password reset. The
    password reset email was never received! Just in desparation I altered the
    email forwarding for our address to add a gmail address (so it would go to
    both there and outlook) and re-requested. Result: the password reset
    arrived in gmail, but not in outlook. We were now fixed, could sign in the
    app, get our tickets and go to our event. But only after 2 very stressful
    days caused by Microsoft's actions. How many others might not have such a
    workaround? Because you are not told an incoming mail has been bounced how
    many people have never received an essential email but have no way of
    knowing? We've also now seen emails bounced from kobo and asda. This is
    terrible and needs sorting very urgently.

        It is best not to use a forwarding service, or if you still want to,
        choose one that uses the Sender Rewrite Scheme (http://www.open-spf.org
        /SRS/). This is the only way to avoid a forwarded email being rejected
        by Outlook. Also, if the email author's address domain is a high-volume
        sender, they must sign the email with an aligned DKIM.

            Thanks, that is interesting information, but as mentioned I have
            been using the forwarding (by the same domain host) for over 20
            years with no problem. Plus, of course, the first two emails from
            AXS's sales systems were delivered successfully. Since it seems
            gmail has no issues with the forwarded email why should I have to
            take action to resolve what appears to be a Microsoft specific
            problem?

    I believe this has had the un-intended effect of blocking all inbound mail
    from high-volume senders to ANYONE with a .NAME domain. 
    I doubt many people at Microsoft have even heard of the .name 3LD's that
    were launched in 2003. Basically anyone could buy their name - so
    freddy.mercury.name came with a free email forwarding service hosted by
    Verisign. You give everyone your email of freddy@ mercury.name and the
    Verisign MX forwarders will forward to your chosen email provider. However
    this breaks SPF as they don't do ARC.

    Microsoft need to white-list the Versign .name fowarders but i've spent 3
    days going in circles with their outsourced tech support to no result
    because none of them can even understand the problem "please add the sender
    to your safe list"

        For high volume senders, Microsoft requires validation of both SPF and
        DKIM, but only one of them needs to be aligned with the Header-From
        domain. If the forwarding service uses SRS and doesn't break DKIM, once
        the email is forwarded, it will have SPF pass & unaligned and DKIM pass
        & aligned, which is sufficient for inbox delivery.

        Forwarding services needs to use SRS.

        Microsoft has been experiencing issues for DKIM validation for years,
        and it appears these problems are causing even more issues now with the
        strengthened email ecosystem. Perhaps Microsoft should have resolved
        these technical challenges before introducing additional requirements.
        Below is a list of top email senders and their percentage of temperrors
        in the last 30 days from over 20k domains:

         

        [bS00NDMxOTYwLVZqVks3eg]

        I have reported this issue to Microsoft multiple times, and in 2024
        Puneeth​ acknowledged, "We are aware of the DNS issue and are actively
        working on several resolutions." Microsoft is clearly aware of the
        problem, but it seems they have not been able to resolve it.

        What Does “Temperror” Mean in SPF or DKIM?
        If you're seeing temperror in SPF or DKIM results, it means the
        receiving email server couldn’t complete the authentication check
        because of a temporary DNS issue. This is not a permanent failure, but
        it can still impact email delivery.

        What Causes It
        SPF temperror may happen due to:

          ☆ DNS timeout or the DNS server is down
          ☆ Too many DNS lookups (limit is 10)
          ☆ Invalid or unreachable SPF includes

        DKIM temperror may happen due to:

          ☆ The public key can’t be retrieved from DNS
          ☆ Wrong DKIM selector or malformed DNS record
          ☆ DNS provider is temporarily unavailable

        Why It Matters

          ☆ Emails may be delayed, flagged, or marked as suspicious
          ☆ DMARC might fail if both SPF and DKIM checks can't be completed
          ☆ Repeated temperrors can damage sender reputation

        How to Fix It

          ☆ Use tools like MXToolbox or dig to test DNS records
          ☆ Keep SPF within the 10-lookup limit
          ☆ Verify that DKIM records are correct and accessible
          ☆ Choose a reliable DNS provider with low latency

        Summary
        SPF and DKIM temperrors are temporary issues that stop email
        authentication from completing. They don’t cause immediate rejection,
        but they can reduce email deliverability and trust. Fixing them ensures
        reliable authentication and protects your domain’s reputation.

                Let me know if you'd like a downloadable or shareable version. 

            If you’re not familiar with the topic of email authentication, it’s
            best not to have AI generate a reply that includes incorrect
            information.

            The “too many DNS lookups (limit is 10)” scenario your AI
            mentioned, as well as having more than two “void DNS lookups,”
            actually result in a permerror , not a temperror. Temperror is
            specifically for temporary issues, like timeouts, DNS servers being
            momentarily unreachable, or transient DNS failures. Permerror, on
            the other hand, covers permanent configuration problems, such as
            exceeding SPF lookup limits or having invalid or missing records.

            So, if you see a temperror, it’s almost always a temporary DNS
            problem (for example, DNS timeout, DNS server not responding, or
            intermittent DNS failures). If you hit DNS lookup limits or have
            structurally invalid records, you’ll get a permerror instead, which
            means the issue must be fixed on the sender’s side.

            Just wanted to help clarify, since this distinction can make a
            difference when troubleshooting email deliverability problems!

        It seems that emails have been rejected so far in the case of temperror
        and this is typically a problem, because the sender is not fully
        responsible for such random errors. This could also occur for DMARC
        temperror.

    As a member of a church organization, I am the registrar for a seminar and
    have 108 couples registered.  I tried to send update notices to my couples,
    most of whom have two addresses so 216 messages.  I encountered several
    bounced notices due to this error.  I am using my normal Yahoo address that
    I have had for almost 30 years.  I rarely send over 20 email messages in a
    day, but occasionally send out group replies.  Now, in rare cases over the
    years, I have had to send out more messages in a day, but never even up to
    500 in one day.  My fingers would give out!  What am I doing to encounter
    these errors and how do I correct the situation so my people get their
    notices?

    We have found a solution!

    After analysing the affected emails, which were blocked by the Microsoft
    servers with "DKIM=Fail", we noticed that these emails all have a
    Content-Transfer-Encoding of 8bit. These mails are not sent from Exchange
    servers, but automatically via another third-party software for customer
    communication (with MailKit framework).

    We then opened a support case at Microsoft and received the following
    response/solution:
    Issue Resolution: Microsoft Outlook servers may have trouble handling 8bit
    encoding when it comes to DKIM validation. One workaround is to change the
    Content-Transfer-Encoding header to quoted-printable, which seems to
    resolve the issue. Additionally, there have been reports that non-ASCII
    characters in the email body can also cause DKIM failures.

    Subsequently, we have changed the email template for mail-creation in the
    third-party software to Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding and now have no
    more problems with the Microsoft servers.

    Perhaps this will help some of those affected.

            Microsoft is experiencing two types of authentication validation
            issues: the first, consistently reproducible, is DKIM validation of
            8-bit bodies or headers; the second, random, is DNS timeouts. It
            appears you are only affected by the second issue.

    Puneeth​ RossAdams​ BrandonKoeller​ please lend an ear with email service
    providers worldwide. The changes you are making are preventing trusted
    companies to reach customers with hotmail, outlook and live addresses.

    Forwarding mail is breaking the dmarc, which is know for many years. But
    neglected worldwide if seperate dkim or spf is uphold.

    Give the ESPs a change to make changes in the headers so the alignment can
    be fixed.

    Since more than a week a growing number of companies are complaining to
    their providers, who in their part are having a hard time getting in touch
    with the correct people at Microsoft.

    Major players like Valimail and Sendgrid are aware of the issues but are
    powerless so it seems.

    Everyone is up for more mail security and less spam/bulk mail, but the way
    things are rolled out now are impacting businesses worldwide.

     

    I hope this message reaches the correct persons and has impact on the
    rollout.

    This seems to break things badly.

    At iki.fi, a non profit society with 30K members, we provide a permanent
    e-mail addresses with mail forwarding.

    Outlook is now rejecting around 1500 - 2000 forwarded mails per day with
    5.7.515 and "Spf= Fail , Dkim= Pass , DMARC= Pass" in explanation.

    Almost everything is coming from well known legitimate sender domains.

    The filtering does not honor the DMARC standard as either SPF pass or DKIM
    pass should be sufficient. Now it requires both to pass.

    SPF is not compatible with email forwarding, Even Microsoft acknowledges 
    this on your https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/
    email-authentication-about www-page.

     

    Is there anything that we can do to get mail flowing again?

     

    We do spam filtering,  we use ARC to sign forwarded emails.

    SRS is not  an options as it breaks DKIM.

    Should we just recommend our members to use some other e-mail provider?

            SRS rewrites headers that are covered with the original DKIM
            signature.

            Of course you can add a new DKIM signature, but it only proves that
            the mail was re-sent by the forwarding server.

            From the security aspect, bad actors may trivially mimic SRS and
            there is no way for the receiver to differentiate legitimate and 
            fake relayed mail.

    @#$%^&*

    Undo whatever you did !

    Can't send any email with attachments to Hotmail accounts. Gmail and other
    accounts okay.

    Fix is way too technical, If the fix would even work as I am NOT using
    Outlook, I am using Yahoo yet I get this error for Outlook.

    Microsoft fix whatever you did. It worked fine before, Put back what was.

    pissed off!

    We've begun receiving 5.7.515 errors showing "Dkim= Fail".  Every tester
    I've run our email through shows DKIM passing completely.  All domains in
    the header match the sending domain.   Any help?

        For about a week now, we've also observed a slight occurrence of dsn=
        5.7.515 errors. Upon checking the logs, we found that 0.01% of all
        email sends resulted in "Dkim= Fail", while the remaining 99.9% were
        successfully delivered. The original messages in the actual bounce
        emails clearly had correct DKIM signatures, and all sender domains are
        the same, so we haven't been able to identify the cause of the DKIM=
        Fail errors. We'd appreciate any potential solutions.

            This occurs because Microsoft uses very short DNS timeouts, if the
            DKIM controller doesn't receive the DNS reply quickly enought, then
            they will judge that DKIM fail.

            Setting long TTL (at least 48h) on your DKIM records will help
            mitigate the problem.

            Please let me know if you get a resolution.  I'll post here, as
            well, if I find something.
