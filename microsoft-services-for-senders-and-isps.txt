                    Email abuse, junk email, and fraudulent emails (phishing)
                    continue to burden the entire email ecosystem. To help
                    build back consumer trust in the use of email, Microsoft
                    has put in place various policies and technologies to help
                    protect our consumers. However, Microsoft understands that
                    legitimate email senders should not be negatively affected.
                    Therefore, we have established a suite of services to help
                    senders improve their deliverability to Outlook.com
                    consumers by proactively managing their sending reputation.

                     ISP Solutions

                    Microsoft understands that no single organization can
                    change or eliminate email abuse on its own. Internet
                    Service Providers (ISPs) play a major role in identifying
                    and curbing abuse as they host millions of email accounts
                    around the world. Therefore, we have built some services to
                    help ISPs gain a good understanding of the type of traffic
                    originating from their networks and reaching Outlook.com
                    customers. ISPs can then use this data to help stop abusive
                    activity (junk email, phishing, etc.) on their networks in
                    order to reduce overall costs and proactively manage their
                    reputation.
